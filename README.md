# Guild Applied

- Apply Guild to real-world projects
- Prefer projects that benefit from experimentation and that have
  large, active contribution communities

## Projects

### Style transfer

Source code: [style-transfer](style-transfer)

## Project candidates

### ControlNet

https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet

### W&B Table Collab

This is an end-to-end data prep and training example but with
W&B. This can serve as an example of an 'applied' scenario. What does
the equivalent look like in Guild?
